Meeting summary:
1. Connect was to work on class diagram and to collate on any missing tasks agreed on our phase 1.
2. Cross verification of codes between team members so we wont have any lag at the end moment.
3. Unit cases was tough to work on as we chose JSP — technology which wasn’t meant for designing unit test cases.

Next meeting Agenda :
