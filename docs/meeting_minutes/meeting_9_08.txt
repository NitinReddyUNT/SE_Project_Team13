Agenda :
* Realisation of Project Implementation Challenges
* Discussion and Exploration of Alternative Approaches
* GitHub and Trello Setup and Training

Meeting summary :
we realised that our original project plan had some big challenges we couldn't overcome. So, we decided to look for new ways to make our project work. We also set up accounts on GitHub and Trello, which are important tools to help us manage our project better. We spent some time learning how to use GitHub, so everyone knows how to work with it. Even though we're changing our plan, we're excited about the new ideas we're exploring, and we're ready to move forward together

Next meeting agenda :
* Documentation Collaboration
* Division of Documentation Tasks
* Project Progress Update - First Deliverable


Meeting Duration : 45 Minutes
