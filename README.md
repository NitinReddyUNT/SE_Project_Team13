This group is all about creating a dynamic project for the course of software engineering
I would like to give you a brief introduction to our project Idea which is "Secure Data Sharing using Blockchain Technology"
The Internet of Things has undergone advancements and one of its applications in cloud computing is data sharing. Despite its appeal, ensuring data security remains a challenge due to the misuse and resulting damages. In this article, we suggest a method called Intermediary Key Conversion to enhance the security of data sharing, in cloud environments. By employing identity-based encryption data owners can securely store their encrypted data in the cloud while an Intermediary Key Conversion mechanism allows authorized users to access that data Because Internet of Things (IoT) devices have resources we utilize edge devices as proxy servers to handle calculations. Moreover, we employ information-centric networking capabilities to efficiently distribute cached content through the proxy thereby improving the quality of service and making use of network capacity. Our system concept is built on technology, which revolutionizes data sharing by enabling control and reducing inefficiencies found in centralized systems. The security analysis and evaluation of our plan illustrate the potential for ensuring data security, confidentiality, and integrity.
