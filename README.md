# SE_Project_Team13
This group is all about creating a dynamic project for the course of software engineering
I would like to give you a brief introduction to our project Idea which is a "crowdfunding platform using blockchain technology".
This project mainly focuses on developing a decentralized standalone application that can create online campaigns that in turn, 
have the capability to raise funds online using the Ethereum platform.
This project brings transparency and security, our blockchain-powered crowdfunding platform empowers individuals to support 
and shape innovative projects while ensuring immutable trust in every transaction.
