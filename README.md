This group is all about creating a dynamic project for the course of software engineering
I would like to give you a brief introduction to our project Idea which is "Secure Data Sharing using blockchain Technology"
The evolution of the Internet of Things has seen data sharing as one of its most useful applications in cloud computing. As eye-catching as this technology has been, data security remains one of the obstacles it faces since the wrongful use of data leads to several damages.
In this Project, we propose a proxy re-encryption approach to secure data sharing in cloud environments. 
Data owners can outsource their encrypted data to the cloud using identity-based encryption, while proxy re-encryption construction will grant legitimate users access to the data.
With the Internet of Things devices being resource-constrained, an edge device acts as a proxy server to handle intensive computations.
Also, we make use of the features of information-centric networking to deliver cached content in the proxy effectively, thus improving the quality of service and making good use of the network bandwidth.
Further, our system model is based on blockchain, a disruptive technology that enables decentralization in data sharing. It mitigates the bottlenecks in centralized systems and achieves fine-grained access control to data. 
The security analysis and evaluation of our scheme show the promise of our approach in ensuring data confidentiality, integrity, and security.
